// Tailwind not working in remote apps: https://github.com/nrwl/nx/issues/9784
// The reason to config css in remote app is that we need remote app to read host tailwind css classes,
// e.g. seed-page-container has classes `container space-y-6`.
// So in standalone remote app, it can render UI just like inside the host app.

/* You can add global styles to this file, and also import other style files */
